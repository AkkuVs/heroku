**Fish Market Prediction Model**

**Project Overview**

The Fish Market Prediction project is a machine learning application that predicts fish species based on various physical features. Using a Random Forest Classifier, the model analyzes attributes such as weight, length, and width of fish to classify them into different species. This project demonstrates the use of classification algorithms in data science to solve real-world problems.

**Model Details**
Model Type: Classification
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Dataset: Fish Market Dataset
Features Used: Weight, Length, Height, Width
Target Variable: Fish Species

**Web Application**
The model is integrated into a Flask web application. Users can interact with the model through a web interface, where they can input fish measurements and receive species predictions. The application is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed online.

**Usage**
To use the application:
Clone the repository and install dependencies.
Run the Flask application locally or deploy it to a platform like Heroku.
Access the web interface to input data and obtain predictions.
